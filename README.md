# RubiksCube
This is a Rubik's Cube simulator. It allows a user to select a cube from size 2x2x2 up to 31x31x31. It displays it in a 2d plane. It saves the time, move count, and current positions of any given solve and records their personal bests.

--INSTRUCTIONS--

Click on the cube size you want to solve in the menu.
Click on "Menu" to return to the menu.
Click on "Scramble" to begin a solve.
Click on "Solve" to quit a solve and put the cube in the solved state.
Use the buttons in the bottom left or the QWEASD keys to rotate the entire cube.
Click on a piece to select what layers you want to turn. Simply select a different piece to deselect the previous piece.
Use the buttons in the bottom right or the arrow keys to rotate the layers associated with the selected piece.

--SPECIFICS--

After finishing a solve, the program will tell you if you got any new personal bests and then it will record them.
The personal bests it records are best time and least moves.
The program will save the position of the pieces, as well as the current time and move count if you are in the middle of a solve.
This save will only happen after clicking the red x. It will NOT save if the quit option is selected in the menu bar.
After scramble is clicked, the timer will only start after rotating a layer.
When returning to a solve after quiting the timer will only start up again after rotating a layer.
Returning to the menu also pauses the timer until you return and rotate a layer.
